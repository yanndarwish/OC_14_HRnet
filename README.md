# HRnet

HRnet is an internal web app helping companies to keep employees records.
For now, the app uses json-server to emulate Back End API endpoints.

## Installation

Start by launching json-server.
In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm run server
```

It launches the Back End json-server:
Open [http://localhost:3000/employees](http://localhost:3000/employees) to view the data in your browser.

Now you can start the React App with:

```bash
npm start
```

Note that the port:3000 is already taken by json-server by default. So you need to start the React App on another port.

Congratulations! You can now use the App!
